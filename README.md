# Neural-Network-Predictor
Software (Standalone): This is a predictive modeling software. In this file software, two training modes (batch and sequential) for classical backpropagation is implemented. All other hybrid-trainings such as the Ant Colony Optimization, Particle  Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Bacteria Foraging Optimization are implemented for batch mode training of Neural Network Only.

Please refer to the  papers included with this contribution for details of this software.
